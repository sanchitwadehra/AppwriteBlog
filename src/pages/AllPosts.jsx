// Ohhh, I see what's going on! üòè So it seems the issue was related to how you were passing props into `PostCard`.

// When you used this line:

// ```jsx
// <PostCard {...post} />
// ```

// It works because you're spreading all the properties of `post` directly as individual props to `PostCard`. However, when you were doing:

// ```jsx
// <PostCard post={post} />
// ```

// You were passing the entire `post` object as a single prop, which means `PostCard` would need to access the post data as `props.post` instead of just using `props` directly. Maybe `PostCard` was expecting the props to be spread out rather than passed as a single object. ü§î

// Glad it worked out though! Now your posts should render smoothly, without the crash. üòé
